# LAUNCH AN EC2 INSTANCE THAT WILL SERVE AS “WEB SERVER”
 
 Log in to your AWS account and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
Click on the "Launch Instance" button.
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that supports your desired web server software. For example, you can choose an Amazon Linux 2 AMI if you plan to install Apache web server.
Choose an instance type that fits your needs. For a simple web server, you can choose a t2.micro instance type.
Configure the instance details such as the number of instances, network settings, and storage.
Add any additional storage you may need for your web server files.
Add any required tags to your instance.
Configure security groups to allow inbound traffic to your web server. For example, you can allow HTTP traffic on port 80 and HTTPS traffic on port 443.
Review your configuration and launch the instance.
Once the instance is launched, connect to it using SSH or any other remote access tool.
Install and configure your web server software.
Upload your website files to the appropriate directory on the web server.
Test your website by accessing it using the instance's public IP address.
That's it! You now have a web server running on an EC2 instance. Just make sure to keep your instance and software up to date and properly secured to ensure the safety and reliability of your website.
